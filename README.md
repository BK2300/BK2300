- Goals after my studies?📚🧑‍🎓
Hopefully working for a giant consultent company or and bank, to really work with big scale companies

- Done with learning after?
HELL NO! Ive quit gaming completly and found out a new satisfaction with learning new stuff. After getting the basics done, from my data science masters. Im going to learn "ML for finance". 🤖💸🏦

Starting up my own predictive analysis agency and having a couple of investment bankers as my main clients
